            <strong>UK</strong>&rdquo;) (and Gibraltar), or Switzerland in

          <ul>
            <li>
              As a data controller, we collect and Process EU, UK and Swiss
              Personal Information directly from individuals, either via our
              publicly available website&nbsp;

              through our mobile applications, or in connection with our
              customer relationships.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where we provide our Services in connection with an enterprise
              agreement, we may obtain and process EU, UK, and Swiss Personal
              Information on behalf of and at the instructions of our enterprise
              customers. In that context, such customers are the data
              controllers and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            Notice describes our privacy practices. When providing our Services
            as a Data Processor, our customers determine the categories of

            with these purposes unless subsequently authorized by you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We take reasonable steps to limit the collection and usage of
            Personal Information to that which is relevant for the purposes for
            which it was collected, and to ensure that such Personal Information
            is reliable, accurate, complete and current. Individuals are
            encouraged to keep their Personal Information with Revent up to date
            and may contact Revent as indicated below or in the Policy to
